You will then create a Python function called `get_datamuse_nouns_for_adjective`, that makes use the API. This function takes a specific adjective (as a string) as input. The function then queries the Datamuse API for the nouns that are most often described by the specific adjective. The function then returns the top 5 words of the result. As an example: for the adjective `yellow`, your function should return the list: `['fever', 'color', flowers', 'light', 'colour']`."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"3eYSphIyoIUB"},"outputs":[],"source":["#Step #1: Import required modules\n","import requests\n","import json\n","\n","#Step #2 Define Function\n","def get_datamuse_nouns_for_adjective(adjective):\n","    parameters = {'rel_jja': adjective}\n","    response = requests.get(\"https://api.datamuse.com/words\", params=parameters)\n","    results = response.json()\n","    nouns = [word['word'] for word in results[0:5]] #List comprehension that collects the first five nouns for chosen adjective\n","    if results:\n","        print(f\"The following five nouns are frequently modified by the adjective '{adjective}': {nouns}.\")\n","    else:\n","        print(f\"Sorry, the Datamuse API does not contain any nouns for the adjective '{adjective}'.\\n\"\n","              f\"Please ensure there are no typos or visit https://www.datamuse.com/api/ for more information.\")\n","              #Error message letting user know they should check their word or visit the Datamuse API.\n","\n","#Step #3: Execute Function\n","get_datamuse_nouns_for_adjective(\"yellow\")\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#Step #1: Import required modules\n","import requests\n","import json\n","from pprint import pprint\n","\n","#Step #2 Define Function\n","\n","query = {'rel_jja': 'yellow'}\n","response = requests.get(\"https://api.datamuse.com/words\", params=query)\n","results = response.json()\n","nouns = [peanut['word'] for peanut in results[0:5]]\n","pprint(nouns)"],"metadata":{"id":"sasWa8hvo3Lb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"private_outputs":true,"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
